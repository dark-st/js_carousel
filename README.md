# Project "Square Studio Carousel"
*Deployed on GitHub Pages. [Check the working result!](https://dark-st.github.io/js_carousel/)*

### Used:
- JS
- CSS
- HTML

The purpose of this project is to create a responsive carousel. <br>
I developed an ability to stop/start, pause on hover and slide images with arrows. Also, I did some experimentation with CSS designs, animations and fonts.
